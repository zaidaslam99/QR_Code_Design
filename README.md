## QR-Code Snippet

```html
<body>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="card">
        <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="" />
        <div class="text">
          <h2>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>
          <p>
            Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding
            skills to the next level
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
```

## Lessons Learned

So here let us examine the body section, within it, we have a container and within that container, we have another container. We then pass the image into the second container and inside it, we are passing another container. The innermost container is going to be having the <h2> and <p> tags. The thing that I learned from doing this is that the QR-Code has to be looked at in 3 parts the outer white part is the outermost container. We then have the middle part which is going to be the image that is going to be beveled out. The last part is going to be the inner section on the bottom that is going to be holding the text. All three have to be in unison so that the QR-Code can look more complete. Another thing that we learn in this is the positioning of the two inner container within the big container to give it a boxy look.
